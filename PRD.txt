Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project: Scalable City-Specific Service Pages (Oviedo, Winter Park, Lake Mary, Orlando, Longwood)
Version: 1.0 (Draft)
Owner: Elias (Marketing/Ops)
Date: July 25, 2025

1. Background / Problem Statement
Curated Cleanings needs five unique, SEO/AI‑optimized city pages to:

Increase qualified organic traffic and leads for “house cleaning {City, FL}” queries.

Feed Google’s local ranking signals (relevance, prominence) and AI Overviews (AIO).

Convert visitors with clear CTAs while staying within severe cash and labor constraints.

Problem: Existing content is generic; no unique city pages; limited internal process to reliably produce high-quality, non-duplicative, locally relevant content. Manual drafting is time-consuming.

2. Goals & Success Metrics
Goal	KPI / Target	Deadline	Priority
Publish 5 city pages adhering to this spec	5 live URLs	30 days from kick-off	P0
Rank each page top 3 organic for “house cleaning {city} fl” & “maid service {city}”	≥3/5 pages top 3 within 90 days	Sept 30, 2025	P1
Increase organic leads from target cities	+15 qualified leads/month from organic	60 days post-publish	P1
Eligibility for AI Overviews (detected via query tests)	≥3/5 pages surfaced in AIO snippets	90 days	P2

3. Scope
In-Scope
Requirements, prompts, data templates, QA checks for AI-generated content.

JSON-LD schema generation (LocalBusiness, Service, FAQPage).

Internal linking plan, basic publishing SOP.

Minimal design guidance (images/alt text list).

Measurement framework (GSC, GBP, CWV checks).

Out-of-Scope
Full backlink/citation campaign execution.

GBP optimization tasks (covered in separate project).

Complex CRO testing beyond title/meta iteration.

Multilingual content.

4. Users / Personas
Content Operator (You/VA): Feeds data, runs prompts, reviews output.

AI Agent (LLM): Generates drafts, schema, QA checklist results.

Technical Publisher (Developer/You): Implements pages, schema, internal links.

End User (Homeowner in each city): Needs trust, clarity, and easy booking.

5. Key Assumptions
An LLM (e.g., GPT-4.x or Claude) can follow structured prompts reliably.

You can supply accurate local data (ZIPs, testimonials, pricing).

Pages will be hosted on curatedcleanings.com with control over HTML/JSON-LD.

Limited budget means we must minimize paid tooling.

6. Functional Requirements
Notation: FR# = Functional Requirement, P# = Priority (P0 critical → P2 nice-to-have)

ID	Requirement	Description	Priority	Acceptance Criteria
FR1	Input Data Collector	System to capture per-city variables (keyword, ZIPs, landmarks, offer, testimonial) in structured YAML/JSON.	P0	Completed YAML for all 5 cities; no blank mandatory fields.
FR2	SERP Recon Module	Agent must analyze top 5 organic + 3 local competitors to note H1s, FAQs, gaps.	P1	Recon summary per city included in prompt or separate note.
FR3	Prompt Sandwich Generator	Automated construction of Instruction/Data/Output blocks to feed LLM.	P0	Prompt includes: constraints, data block, output spec, QA checklist.
FR4	Draft Content Generator	LLM returns full page with Title, Meta, URL slug, H1, body (900–1,200 words), FAQs, CTA, schema, image list.	P0	Output sections present & ordered; word count within range.
FR5	Keyword & Entity Check	Agent validates primary keyword placement, secondary terms use, uniqueness vs. other pages.	P0	Checklist indicates Y/N for: Title/H1 match, occurrences 5–12, duplicate detection.
FR6	Schema Builder	LLM outputs valid JSON-LD blocks for LocalBusiness, Service, FAQPage.	P0	JSON-LD parses without errors in validator; includes city-specific data.
FR7	Internal Link Suggestion	List of at least 2 contextual internal links (anchor → URL) per page.	P1	Present with descriptive anchors, not generic “click here”.
FR8	Quick Answer Box	50–80 word summary answering “best house cleaning in {City}?” immediately after intro.	P1	Box is present, concise, includes primary keyword once.
FR9	QA & Self-Verification	Agent must output a self-check section (Y/N confirmations).	P0	All required checks are answered; failures flagged.
FR10	Human Review Workflow	Operator reviews facts, testimonials, CTAs, fixes hallucinations.	P0	Checklist signed off before publish.
FR11	Publishing SOP	Steps to upload HTML, inject schema, add internal links, submit to GSC.	P1	SOP doc completed; pages live & indexed.
FR12	Tracking & Iteration	Post-publish: monitor GSC impressions/CTR, adjust titles/meta after 28 days.	P2	Schedule set, baseline recorded, adjustments logged.

7. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
ID	Requirement	Metric / Threshold
NFR1	Uniqueness	<30% sentence overlap across city pages (measured via similarity tool).
NFR2	Accuracy	Zero fabricated data points (prices, ZIPs, landmarks) without source approval.
NFR3	Performance	LCP <2.5s, INP <200ms, CLS <0.1 on mobile (CWV).
NFR4	Maintainability	New city page can be produced end-to-end in ≤3 hours by VA after process lock-in.
NFR5	Cost	No additional monthly tools >$50 unless approved.

8. Detailed Workflow
Prep (Day 0–2):

Fill DATA_BLOCK YAML per city.

Gather testimonials and offers.

SERP Recon (Automated or Manual):

Record competitors, headings, word counts, FAQs.

Prompt Assembly:

Insert YAML into Prompt Sandwich template.

Add recon insights.

If structure missing, re-prompt with failures.

QA Pass (Agent Self-Check):

Verify keyword counts, length, schema presence.

Human Review:

Fact-check, polish CTAs, add internal link anchor texts.

Publish:

Push HTML/Markdown.

Implement JSON-LD.

Add internal links from nav, homepage, related posts.

Submit URL to GSC.
