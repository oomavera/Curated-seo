üìù PRD: Curated Cleanings Website Refactor
Date: 2025-08-01
Owner: Elias (Founder)
Developer Implementation Environment: Claude Code / Modern JS full-stack
Goal: Refactor landing page to improve conversions and simplify the UX

üéØ Objective
Redesign the main landing page (/) to remove friction by replacing the interactive booking calculator and 3D house visualization with a simpler, high-converting lead form. Move the booking estimator to a new route (/bookonline) for cleaner flow and performance.

‚úÖ Scope of Work
1. Landing Page (/) Changes
REMOVE:

Booking calculator component (currently includes frequency, bed/bath, and add-ons selectors)

3D house visualization (three.js element)

Entire component wrapper that houses both

ADD:

New Lead Form Component titled "Quick Free Estimate" with fields:

Full Name (text input)

Phone Number (tel input)

Email (email input)

Submit Button labeled: Get Quick Estimate

On submit:

Save form data to leads table (or API endpoint /api/leads)

Trigger Cal.com popup (use embedded widget)

Responsive Layout Behavior:

Desktop (min-width: 768px):

Left: static image (marketing photo or branding graphic)

Right: lead form (Quick Free Estimate)

Mobile (max-width: 767px):

Lead form is center-justified directly under the H1 ("Trusted House Cleaning for Greater Orlando")

Form fields are full width

2. New Page: /bookonline
Move existing booking calculator UI to this route as a standalone booking flow

Path: /bookonline

Retain full feature logic: frequency, bed/bath selectors, add-ons dropdown, real-time price estimate

Ensure SEO meta tags updated for this page (title, description: ‚ÄúOnline Booking | Curated Cleanings‚Äù)

3. Deactivated Component: 3D House
Temporarily remove from frontend DOM & app logic

Leave component file in repo under /components/HouseVisualizer.tsx

Flag it with a comment like: /* Deactivated: August 1, 2025 ‚Äî may reinstate in future */

üß© Components to Build or Modify
Component	Status	Notes
LeadForm.tsx	New	Form component, mobile/desktop logic, Cal.com integration
LandingPage.tsx	Modify	Remove old components, add LeadForm, adjust layout
BookingCalculator.tsx	Move	Relocate and mount under /bookonline
HouseVisualizer.tsx	Deprecated	Retain in codebase but not rendered

üîå Backend / API
POST /api/leads

Payload: { name, phone, email, source: 'Landing Page' }

Return: 200 OK or error

If backend DB is used (e.g., Postgres or Firebase), insert into leads table with timestamp

üîó Cal.com Integration
Use Cal.com popup embed code (assume available)

Trigger after successful form submission

Allow re-opening with user action if needed

Ensure accessibility (tab focus, closeable)

üìê Visual / UI Notes
Form fields should have clean borders, clear labels

Desktop spacing should respect 12-column layout or Tailwind 2-column flex/grid

Button should be prominent, contrast color, loading spinner during async submit
