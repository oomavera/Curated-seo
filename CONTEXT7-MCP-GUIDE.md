# Using Context 7 MCP to Write Better Code for This Website

## What is Context 7 MCP?
Context 7 MCP (Multi-Context Platform) is an advanced developer tool that provides powerful code search, semantic understanding, and instant documentation lookup across your codebase and dependencies. It helps you:
- Find code by meaning, not just by text
- Instantly access documentation for libraries and APIs
- Understand how and where things are used in your project
- Write, refactor, and debug code more efficiently

## Why Use Context 7 MCP?
- **Semantic Search:** Find functions, components, or logic by describing what they do, not just their names.
- **Instant Documentation:** Get up-to-date docs for any library (like React, Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind, etc.) without leaving your editor.
- **Code Navigation:** Jump to definitions, usages, and related code quickly, even in large projects.
- **Best Practices:** See examples and recommended patterns from official docs and your own codebase.

## How to Use Context 7 MCP in This Project

### 1. Semantic Code Search
- Use Context 7 MCP's search to ask questions like:
  - "Where is the lead form submitted?"
  - "How is the estimate calculated?"
  - "Show me all components that use HouseVisualization."
- This is much faster and more accurate than traditional text search, especially in a Next.js app with many files and components.

### 2. Documentation Lookup
- Instantly pull up documentation for any library used in this project:
  - Example: `mcp docs react useState`
  - Example: `mcp docs next.js routing`
- You can also search for best practices, usage examples, and API changes for libraries like Supabase, Tailwind, etc.

### 3. Refactoring and Debugging
- Use semantic search to find all usages of a function or component before renaming or refactoring.
- Ask Context 7 MCP to show you all places a certain prop or state is used.
- Quickly identify dead code or unused imports.

### 4. Best Practices for Next.js/React
- Use Context 7 MCP to:
  - Find recommended patterns for data fetching, state management, and component design.
  - See how to implement features like SSR, API routes, or authentication the "Next.js way."
  - Get instant answers about Tailwind utility classes, accessibility, and performance tips.

### 5. Example Workflows
- **Adding a Feature:**
  1. Search for similar features/components to reuse code.
  2. Lookup docs for any new library or API you want to use.
  3. Use code navigation to understand dependencies and data flow.
- **Debugging:**
  1. Search for where a value is set/used.
  2. Lookup error messages or API docs instantly.
  3. Find all related code paths quickly.

## Tips
- Use natural language queries—Context 7 MCP understands intent, not just keywords.
- Combine code search and docs lookup for maximum productivity.
- Use it regularly to keep your codebase clean, consistent, and maintainable.
