      <h2>Why Choose Curated Cleanings in Orlando</h2>
      <p>Orlando isn’t one-size-fits-all. Downtown apartments need quick-turn tidy-ups; College Park estates demand meticulous dusting around antiques; Lake Eola Heights homes battle pollen and pet hair. Our approach adapts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flexible scheduling for city life:</strong> Weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly recurring cleaning.</li>
        <li><strong>Eco-friendly options:</strong> Request green products without losing cleaning power.</li>
        <li><strong>Room-by-room photo QA:</strong> Cleaners upload images; managers verify same day.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent, flat-rate pricing:</strong> Typical visit averages $188—no surprise upsells.</li>
        <li><strong>Locally trusted:</strong> “Curated Cleanings made my downtown apartment feel brand new,” says Patrick from Orlando.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Move-In/Move-Out Cleaning</h3>
      <p>Lease ending in Thornton Park or moving into Baldwin Park? We scrub cabinets, tubs, fridges, and fixtures so you hand over (or receive) a spotless space. Pair this with our photo QA if you need landlord proof.</p>
