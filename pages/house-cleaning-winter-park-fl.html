      <p>Stop juggling chores between meetings and school runs. Choose a cadence that fits your household—weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. We aim to assign the same team so they learn your preferences (e.g., how you want marble counters wiped or which rooms are off-limits).</p>

      <h3>Move-In/Move-Out Cleaning</h3>
      <p>Switching homes near Lake Killarney or prepping a listing in Winter Park Pines? We’ll scrub cabinets, appliances (upon request), and fixtures so buyers, landlords, or new tenants are impressed. Need documentation? Our photo QA doubles as proof-of-condition.</p>
