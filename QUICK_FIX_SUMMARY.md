# Photo Gallery White Boxes Fix - Quick Summary

## Problem
Gallery showed white boxes during scroll animation, then images popped in one by one.

## Root Cause
CSS animation started BEFORE browser finished painting cached images to DOM.

## Solution: Three-Phase Loading
```typescript
// Phase 1: Preload images (existing)
await Promise.all(loadPromises);

// Phase 2: Render with opacity 0 (NEW)
setGalleryImages(uniqueImages);
setImagesLoaded(true);
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100)); // Critical 100ms delay

// Phase 3: Fade in and animate (NEW)
setImagesReady(true);
```

## Changes Made

### /home/varga/dev/Curated/Curated-seo/src/app/page.tsx

**Added state variable (line 63):**
```typescript
const [imagesReady, setImagesReady] = useState(false);
```

**Updated loading logic (lines 107-123):**
- Added 100ms delay after `setImagesLoaded(true)`
- Added `setImagesReady(true)` after delay
- Detailed comments explain the timing

**Updated desktop gallery (lines 225-232):**
```typescript
animation: prefersReducedMotion || !imagesReady ? 'none' : `slideGallery...`,
opacity: imagesReady ? 1 : 0
```

**Updated mobile gallery (lines 278-285):**
Same changes as desktop for consistency.

## Testing
Open: http://localhost:3001 (or http://localhost:3000)

**Expected behavior:**
1. "Loading gallery..." message appears
2. Gallery fades in smoothly after ~600-1100ms
3. NO white boxes appear
4. All images visible when animation starts
5. Smooth professional scrolling

## Why 100ms?
- Browser needs time to decode/composite cached images
- Too short: white boxes return
- Too long: page feels sluggish
- 100ms is the sweet spot

## Result
Gallery now loads professionally with smooth fade-in and zero white boxes!
